# SortGraph
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and play a crucial role in optimizing data arrangement. The Sorting Visualizer project provides an interactive way to see how different sorting algorithms work step by step. By visualizing the sorting process, you can gain insights into how these algorithms operate and compare their performance.


# Supported Algorithms
The Sorting Visualizer currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

# Bubble Sort 
 # Selection Sort
# Insertion Sort
# Merge Sort
# Quick Sort
# Heap Sort
